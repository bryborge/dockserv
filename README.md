## About the Project

DockServ is a stack of containerized open-source web applications served behind a reverse proxy service.

This project was heavily
influenced by
[this](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-2-docker-tutorial/)
tutorial and
[this](https://github.com/htpcBeginner/docker-traefik)
project.

### Built With

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Engine for building/containerizing applications.
*   [Traefik Proxy](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) - Edge Router that makes publishing your services a fun and easy experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will walk you through the process of setting up this project on a live system.
The following assumes that you have direct (keyboard/monitor) or indirect (ssh) access to the live system you're 
deploying to.

### Prerequisites

*   A live system running a linux distribution (like [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server))
*   A router configured to forward ports `:80`, `:443`, and `:32400` of the live system
*   A web domain provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)
*   Docker
*   Git

### Installation

1.  Clone the project and change into the project directory.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:sonofborge/dockserv.git && cd dockserv
    ```

2.  Create a new `.env` file and edit the environment variable values to suit your configuration.

    ```shell
    cp .env{.dist,}
    ```

3.  Run the Authelia setup script and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ```shell
    bash scripts/setup-authelia.sh
    ```

4.  Run the Redis setup script and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ```shell
    bash scripts/setup-redis.sh
    ```

5.  Run the Postgres setup script and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ```shell
    bash scripts/setup-postgres.sh
    ```

6.  Spin up some or all of your server applications with `docker compose`.

    ```shell
    # Example: specific individual applications
    docker compose up socket_proxy -d
    docker compose up traefik
    ```

    ```shell
    # Example: all applications
    docker compose up -d
    ```

7.  If you're logging into Authelia for the first time, you'll need to setup totp.
